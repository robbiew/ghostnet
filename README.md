# GHOSTnet

## What is GHOSTnet?

**GHOSTnet** is an email and message network for BBSes, with a goal to stir up creativity and further enhance modern BBS experiences, focused on the future of BBSing and growing user activity.

### About GHOSTnet
In 2020, many returned to BBSing to escape social media, forming lifelong friendships. As life returned to "normal", we aim to prevent the decline of BBS activity (again). GHOSTnet wants to keep the community alive by bridging the gap between the old and new while fostering collaboration and non-toxic conversation.

We don't aim to replace networks like FsxNet or WWIVnet but to supplement them, growing the BBS community through innovation, fun, and unique conversation.

**GHOSTNet** allows sysops running WWIV or Talisman BBSes to host their own subs without needing special permission from a network admin/owner, as long as they follow the network rules. This gives sysops the freedom to create unique, private or public, message areas and topics custom taylored to meet the needs of a SysOps desired theme and atmosphere. Note: that while self-hosting / sub flexibility is a unique feature of WWIV or Talisman platforms, and is a powerful tool for those seeking to build and grow their BBS communities, a great line up of FTN message areas will be offered to non WWIV/Talisman platforms to also enjoy.

## GHOSTnet Goals:

1. Bridge WWIV network to FTNs for all BBS Software Platforms and their users.
2. Cater to a broad audience, including a new generation of BBS users and topics of interst to them.
3. Inspire SysOps, developers, artists, and users to grow the GhostNet BBS community.
4. Encourage modern BBS features through mods, coding, and customization tips.
5. Have fun and support one another without overlapping discussion topics found on other networks!

## Requirements:
1. Your BBS is capable of running an Fido or WWIV based network.
2. Your BBS should be customized, not stock, unless a developer.
3. Your BBS must be up for at least 90 days.
4. No BBS ads or messages set to events or auto-added.
5. Be kind and promote free speech while avoiding illegal content and unecessary drama and conflict.
6. No spam.
7. WWIV and Talisman SysOps are encouraged to host relevant subs.

### About WWIVnet:

**WWIVnet** is a BBS-based network using WWIV’s message and network system, similar to FTN networks. Any sysop can create a message/topic and allow others to subscribe. WWIVnet fosters collaboration, free speech, and a customizable experience for BBS sysops and users.

### Bridging Between WWIVNet and FTN Networks

One of GHOSTnet's unique features is the ability to **bridge** messages between WWIVnet and FTN-based networks using Talisman BBS. Talisman allows importing and exporting messages between these two systems, ensuring consistent communication across both network types. This seamless integration lets BBSes maintain the structure and benefits of WWIVnet while also participating in the larger FTN ecosystem, making it easier for sysops to manage and interact with users from both networks. 

This bridging capability helps unify the BBS community, allowing for cross-network discussions without losing the unique strengths of either system.

#### Notes on Bridging:
- FTN and WWIVnet-based subs will have a "common" base for all
- Self-hosted subs may intially only be availible for WWIV and Talisman sysops
- Self-hosted subs may be added to the FTN on a case-by-case basis (it's a manual process right now)
