# GHOSTnet FTN - Network Admin Instructions

### Updating the GHOSTnet Repository

Authorized GitHub users (Designated Network Admins) must use the **fork and pull request** process to update and compile the GhostNet nodelist or infopack. The `compile_nodelist.sh` script is located in the `ftn/nodelist` directory and handles compiling the nodelist and creating the infopack ZIP file and sending back to Github. Special thanks to [Christian Sacks aka MeatLion](https://github.com/christiansacks/tqwnet_nodelist) for the code examples from TQWNet to pull all this together!

### **1. Pre-requisites**
Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- Git installed on your system.
- A working SSH key added to your GitHub account for repository access. Refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to set up your SSH key.
- Required tools installed (included in this repo):
  - `makenl`: Used for compiling the nodelist.
  - Bash shell to run the `compile_nodelist.sh` script.

### **2. Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Fork the Repository**
1. Go to the [GhostNet repository](https://github.com/robbiew/ghostnet) on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

#### **2. Clone Your Fork**
1. Clone your forked repository using SSH:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/ghostnet.git
   ```
   Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd ghostnet
   ```

#### **3. Set the Original Repository as a Remote**
To ensure you can fetch updates from the original repository:
1. Add the original GhostNet repository as an upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:robbiew/ghostnet.git
   ```
2. Verify the remote setup:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   You should see `origin` pointing to your fork and `upstream` pointing to the original repository.

#### **4. Synchronize Your Fork**
Before making changes, ensure your fork is up-to-date with the original repository:
1. Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```
2. Merge the changes into your local `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

#### **5. Make Changes to the Nodelist or Infopack**
1. Navigate to the appropriate directory:
   - To update the nodelist: `cd ftn/nodelist`
   - To update the infopack: `cd ftn/infopack`

2. Edit the necessary files:
   - For the nodelist, make changes to the nodelist text files.
   - For the infopack, update any of the included files, such as instructions, system lists, or echo area information.
3. Save the changes.

#### **6. Compile the Nodelist and Infopack**
1. Navigate to the `ftn/nodelist` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ftn/nodelist
   ```
2. Run the `compile_nodelist.sh` script:
   ```bash
   ./compile_nodelist.sh
   ```
   This script will:
   - Compile the nodelist using `makenl`.
   - Create the updated infopack ZIP file.
   - Commit the changes to Github.


#### **7. Create a Pull Request**
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Pull Request** button.
3. Compare your branch with the original `main` branch of the [GhostNet repository](https://github.com/robbiew/ghostnet).
4. Add a clear title and description of your changes (e.g., "Add node 510:X/XXX, update systems.txt").
5. Submit the pull request.

#### **8. Wait for Review**
The repository maintainers will review your pull request. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.

### **Notes**
- **Changes to the Infopack**: The infopack includes files that end users rely on for instructions, system lists, and echo areas. Ensure these are clearly written and accurate to maintain usability.
- **SSH Key Setup**: Ensure your SSH key is correctly configured to avoid authentication errors. Test your SSH connection with:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
- **Always Pull Updates**: Synchronize your fork with the upstream repository to avoid conflicts before starting any work.
